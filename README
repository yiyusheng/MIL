1. merge_data.py: generate year data from original data for each day
2. filter_data.py: filter invalid column and group data by model
3. preprocess_data.py: filter invalid row, select features, generate train and test tags

experiment.py is useless since MIL is implemented by MATLAB. Thus, I use matlab to make experiment.
